    "Keys for the data are 'RBF_ueV', 'RBF_chi', 'UF_ueV', 'UF_chi', 'HAYSTAC_ueV', 'HAYSTAC_chi', 'ADMX_ueV', 'ADMX_chi', 'CAPP_ueV', and 'CAPP_chi' to obtain exclusions for dark photons for each of these experiments in the polarized and unpolarized cases. Each case has its own .mat file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .py file is the Python code used to calculate cos2(theta), the square of the dot product between the dark photon polarization and the axis of the haloscope cavity in the slowly varying polarized case described in the associated manuscript. The code shows how to calculate cos2(theta) using probability, taking the rotation of the earth into account for longer measurements. (If your computer is slow, you can use the find and replace function in your IDE to change all 'block=True' statements to 'block=False' and also change num_pts=50 instead of 500.)\n",

This means that their data does not actually have any sensitivity to the hidden photon! So their data is only here for coding reasons, not science reasons."
