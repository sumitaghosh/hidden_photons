# Hidden Photons from Axion Exclusions
 Minimal code that converts axion exclusions to hidden photon exclusions.
 Will eventually incorporate experiment-specific time sensitivity data from the HAYSTAC experiment.

For a walk-through of this code, see this Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/sumitaghosh/hidden_photons/blob/main/examples/simple_conversions.ipynb
